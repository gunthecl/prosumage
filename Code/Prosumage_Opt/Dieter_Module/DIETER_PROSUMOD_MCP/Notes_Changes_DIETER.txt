#### System Section ####
5b has been changed to only incorporated bio (instead of all dispatchables).
2a and 2b on load level dispatchables has been summarized into 2.
4a and 4b has  on storage level been summarized into 4.
Deleted constraint 4.k (on max E/P ratio) and 4j (storage ending).
Deleted constraint 4h and 4i on max in / max out of storage.
Change set index hh to h in energy blanace.
No binding minRes restriction. 
Storage level in t=0 must be zero, i.e. phi_sto_ini(sto) = 0.
Use dispatch version with different fixed values.
Deleted nuc and all storages without fixed capacities.

#### Prosumage Section #####
Constraint con11c on self-consumption rate not used.
Equation con11d and 11h on storage level summarized into one.
Initial storage level is zero (phi_sto_pro_ini(sto) = 0 ).
Introduce subset set res_pro and sto_pro for prosumage household technologies and storages.
Changed ordering of res_pro and sto_pro in variables.
Changed indices sto and res in objective variable to sto_pro and res_pro.
